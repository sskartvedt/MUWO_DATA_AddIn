            1. Download the Community Sample data (see under the "Resources" section for downloading sample data).  The sample data contains a project called "FeatureTest.aprx" with data suitable for this sample.  Make sure that the Sample data is unzipped in c:\data and "C:\Data\FeatureTest\FeatureTest.aprx" is available.
